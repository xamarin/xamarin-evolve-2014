Recently I was lucky enough to be offered a sip from a co-worker, whose mother had brought it for him from Belgium. Not having tasted all of the world's beers, it's hard to say whether it was the best, but I can say that  it tasted amazing - the most perfect blend of complex flavors - malt and hops and molasses and deliciousness... it was heavenly (not to mention 10.2% alcohol). Excellent podcast and mini-story about this beer .Latin script on the back of the bottle reads:<em>Ad aedificandam abbatiam adiuvi.</em>Which Google Translate tells me roughly means \"To help build the Abbey.\"   ",

Three days a week, you do five sets of increasing difficulty, for example 14, 19, 14, 14, 25. \rUnfortunately, the program doesn't really account for the fact that muscles don't build as quickly as you get older. Nor does it warn you that it starts out pretty fun, but gets excruciating as you head into week 4 or 5.\rThis is not me :)\r\rNo matter - if you don't complete a day, you just repeat it until you do. Truthfully, I've been working on the program for over a year, but every time I build up into week 4, it gets to be such an exertion that I wimp out and skip doing pushups entirely. \rFinally realized that it's more important to stay in shape than it is to complete the program. So I've gone into \"maintenance\" mode, doing Week 4 Day 2 over and over again. It's just strenuous enough to be a good workout, but not so intense that I skip them. \rStill, I'd like to pick up the pace again sometime and complete the program. It would feel amazing to do 100 without stopping.",

        "notes": " is a sport/hobby that involves using geographical coordinates and a GPS to look for containers hidden in the woods, in cities, on top of mountains, underwater, in lamp posts, inside of logs, etc. When you find one, you sign a log to prove you were there, and optionally take a prize from the cache, replacing it with a new one of equal or greater value.\rIt's not about the prizes though - they tend to be pretty lame. The fun is in exploring trails and areas you might never have visited otherwise - it's a great way to discover new terrain. It can also become a semi-competitive sport, once you get into it. Geocachers compete to find the most caches in an area, to find caches in every county or state, etc. \r\rEvery cache has two difficulty ratings: The difficulty of the hide itself (how well concealed it is) and the difficulty of the terrain (how hard is it to get to). Most caches are in the 2/3 or 3/2 range. Caches with a terrain rating of 5 require specialized gear to get to, such as scuba equipment, mountain climbing rigs, or hot air balloons :)\rOf course, the most challenging caches of all are rated 5/5 - extremely well hidden and extremely hard to get to. Before I die, I'm going to find one...\r\r<em>shacker pulling an ammo can cache from Minkalo Cliffs, near Tahoe.</em>\r ",

Slacklining is distinct from tightrope walking in that the line is not held rigidly taut (although it is still under some tension); it is instead dynamic, stretching and bouncing like a long and narrow trampoline. The line's tension can be adjusted to suit the user and different types of dynamic webbing can be used to achieve a variety of feats. The line itself is flat, due to the nature of webbing, thus keeping the slacker's footing from rolling as would be the case with an ordinary rope. The dynamic nature of the line allows for impressive tricks and stunts.",

While it may look a bit dangerous, these ropes and cables are capable of supporting an entire car - your body weight is nothing to the equipment.
